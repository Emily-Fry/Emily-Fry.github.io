                What learnings did you take from the chapter?

                I loved this quote "What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters to what lies within us".
               
                <div>
                <em>
                    -Ralph Waldo Emerson
                </em>   
                </div>
                <div>
                    It's so true that we are only as compassionate and strong as we push ourselves to be, and this is a learned ability.
                    I think the concept that we can teach ourselves to be more emotionally intelligence, and treat it like a 'practice' is great, as it gives us all something to work toward, rather than lament we wern't born a certain way.
                    I also liked how the author links to the real benefits of EQ:
            </div>
                <ul>
                <li>Stellar work performance</li>
                <li>Outstanding leadership</li>   
                <li>The ability to create the conditions for happiness</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <em>Can't argue with that!</em>
                </div>       
    </p>

                <strong>
                    How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? 
                </strong>
            </h4>
                    Not new information for me: I'm not the greatest meditator. Lol. I just sat there and thought about lots of stuff...plans this weekend, whats for dinner... (typical). But the concept is totally not lost on me, I would love to properly get into it. 
                    Practice makes perfect I guess!
