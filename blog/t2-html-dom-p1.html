        <h4>
        <strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
        </strong>
        </h4>

        HTML is used to create the basic structure and content of a web page.
        CSS is used to design the HTML webpage - ie where everything is place and how it looks.
        The DOM is a bit confusing. Aparently Javascript can manipulate the DOM, and I guess I'll learn about that soon! My most basic understanding is that
        DOM is the browser interpretation of the HTML.

            <strong>What is meant by boxifying design?
            </strong>
        </h4>

        Boxifying is a technical term to describe how HTML elements are wrapped in boxes.

                <strong>What is the box model?
                </strong>
            </h4>
            All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
            The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
            It is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 
            The image below illustrates the box model:

            <div class="image"><img src="box-model.jpg"></div>
    </p>
