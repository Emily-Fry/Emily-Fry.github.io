            <h4>
                    <strong> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
                    </strong>
            </h4>
            
                <p> I really enjoyed it. Conversations really can be so much more meaningful when you slow down and really be present.
                    It was nice to be forced to slow down and bring my mind right into the conversation. 

                </p>

                <h4>
                        <strong> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
                        </strong>
                </h4>
                <p> Definately the walking meditation. I love walking and any opportunity to get outside so this one really appeals to me.
