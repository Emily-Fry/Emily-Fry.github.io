      The EDA experience is clearly quite different from the typical university or school learning expereince. It's values driven, inclusive, and pracitcal. So far I am really enjoying it.

        My impression is that is a very inclusive learning environment. Although it will be challenging and tough at times, if we are open minded, kind, and put in the effort, we will be supported and succeed.

       I think I will enjoy having the opportunity to learn completely new concepts, and I will enjoy getting to know people from all sorts of different backgrounds. However, I do tend to get frustrated easily, I tend to be quite slow (particularly when it comes to practical learning) and I'm impatient! I quite aware this isn't the best recipe for success so I will need to be very aware of myself, and not stress if I'm behind others.

      I'm both excited and nervous! I am a complete beginner, and my top subjects are History and English! So I am really getting out of my comfort zone doing something so practical like this.
