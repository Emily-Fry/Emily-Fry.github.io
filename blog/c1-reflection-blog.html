    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
            It's a great concept. I like that it is values based and very inclusive of all people and learning styles.
    <h2>What are your impressions</h2>
            It's a really inclusive environment. Students will get out what they put in and approach the bootcamp with a positive and open mindset. It's as much about helping others and learning about yourself as it is about learning to code.
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<h2>
            I'm excited by it. I think it's a great way to learn. I think I will benefit from the habits and reflective exercises that are taught. I plan to be very open minded and take each day as it comes.
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
            It's probably too early to tell!
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kindof learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
            I'm very excited. I'm only nervous that I won't be able to keep up with all the learning!
