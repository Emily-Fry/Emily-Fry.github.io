        <h6> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2? </h6>
            <p> have always thought of meditation as being a type of mindfulness - sitting down and really being present.
                Although I have attempted it at different points in my life, it's never something I have managed to find value in, 
                simply because i'm not really sure how to do it correctly.
            </p>
       
        <h6> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h6>
            <p>I really liked the analogy to exercise - this struck a cord with me because I love exercise, 
                particularly high intensity exercise, but never had thought of mindfulness as being in a similar category.
            </p>

        <h6> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you? </h6>

           <p>"Breathing, as if your life depends on it" - Nice summary! </h6>
        
        <h6> Any other musings?</h6>
            <p>I read John Kabat-Zans book years ago - it could be worth a re-read now I think!</p>
