      I've been focussing on the pomodoro technique - something I saw some of my peers apply at University. I think it could be helfpul in certain circumstances, like if the content was super dry or just needed memorising. However, I find that if I'm truly engaged in the content, I don't need to worry to much about forcing myself to work for 25 minutes at a time. If I'm in the zone I reckon it could be distruptive to stop every 25 minutes. I suppose the question I will need to test with this technique is 'would my work be more effective' if I used it? I'm all about working smarter not longer!

      The concept of mindfulness in study is very interesting to me - I've always been fascinated by mindfulness and inspired by how it has improved the lives of so many people. Never have managed to get into the swing of it myself unfortunately!

      Staying physically active throughout the day works for me - whether that means going for a walk, using my standing desk, or heading to the gym.

    I would like to explore the materials in more depth in order to understand how best to incorporate mindfulness in my day.
