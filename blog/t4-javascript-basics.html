            <h4>
                    <strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
                    </strong>
            </h4>
            
                <p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage.

                    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for the design of a webpage – where everything is placed and how it looks
                    
                   In contrast, JavaScript is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage users
                </p>

                <h4>
                        <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing teeth'
                        </strong>
                </h4>
                <p> Control flows and loops enables the script to make decisions and repeat tasks until specified criteria are met.
                    For example, a real life example would be that we can't possibly brush our teeth until we wake up. So in JavaScript terms, our brain keeps asking us to 
                    wake up before we can move on to another function - eg brush our teeth. 
                    A more website related example would be repeatedly asking a user on an e-commerce site to enter a credit card number until a valid creidit card number
                    is entered. 
                </p>
                
                 <h4>
                            <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
                            </strong>
                 </h4>
                 <p> Arrays are best used when order is the most important factor for organizing the information.
                        When you retrieve information from the array, you use the index of each element. Arrays are 0-indexed, which means they start counting at 0 rather than 1.
                        An example would be reading through a novel's content page - each chapter should be read in order. 
                        Objects are best used when the information can be organized based on data labels - for example a newspaper. It is not neccessary to read a newspaper in order, rather a person 
                        can go straight to a section that interests them - eg sports. 
                 </p>

                 <h4>
                        <strong>What are functions and why they are useful?
                        </strong>
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure 
                    —a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. 
                    To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
                    Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the 
                    variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and 
                    functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined. In other words, a function defined in the 
                    global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another 
                    function can also access all variables defined in its parent function and any other variable to which
                     the parent function has access.
