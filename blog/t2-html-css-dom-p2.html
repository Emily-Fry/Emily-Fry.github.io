        <strong>What is grid based design?
        </strong>
        </h4>

        Grid based design follows a grid design pattern, which our eyes are naturally drawn to. 
        Grid based design provides for a clean user experience, and so nearly all websites follow this pattern.

            <strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
            </strong>
        </h4>

        Responsibe webpages are cool because they allow users to have the same experience of the website regardless of
        how they are viewing the content - whether it be ipad,laptop, or phone. The webpage responds to the device.

        <h4>
            <strong>What is semantic structure?
            </strong>
        </h4>
        Semantic tags are used in HTML to style the page. For example the tag -h2- indicates that the text is a ...<h2>Heading!</h2>
        Other tags instruct the page that the text should be bold, italic, or even that an image should be inserted.

        <strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?
        </strong>
    </h4>
        Honestly I still feel like I have only scratched the surface with this content. I'm still
        a bit confused about the relationship between CSS. HTML. and the DOM, and I find the DOM 
        hard to read - it's not a great user experience. The thing I found most interesting in this lesson was 
        noticing how all websites use a grid layout, and seeing how to create negative space.
