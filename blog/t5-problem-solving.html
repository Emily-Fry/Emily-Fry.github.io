    <h4> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>
        <li>Solved the problem in an elegant way</li>
    </ol>
    

        <p> I have been stuck on many problems during this course so it's hard to pick one!
            What I am realising is that an enormous attention to detail is required to avoid making 'silly mistakes'
            Having an extra comma here or there can make or break your code.
            One example I can think of occured during sprint 5.
            I to stuck, and after some time trying, I looked at the text book solution to see if I could work backwards.
            I saw it and panicked!
            It might as well have been in japanese to me, and didn't relate to anything I had learnt.
            I used the code-help-desk to ask.
            Kelly from EDA responded to me and really helped me to use the Rubber Ducky Method (although Kelly was playing Rubber Ducky!)
            She make me walk through the steps, and talk through what I was trying to get the code to do.
            It really helped my thought process for future challenges.
            I went from feeling very lost, to frustrated, to having a bit of an 'aha' moment.
            I learned that there are many ways to code to get the same result, which was interesting.
            I learned that I should stay calm and step out the process for future challenges.
            Although I'm not sure I'd call my behaviour 'elegant' that word has certainly made me ponder how I can be more elegant with my coding issues in the future!
        </p>

        <p> In terms of problem solving techniques, I don't really feel confident using any of them currently.
            Although I've attempted all of them, I still havn't been very successful in getting results.
            However, at least I can say I am aware of them all now - which is miles ahead of where I was a few weeks ago.
            I'm sure I will see results with time.
