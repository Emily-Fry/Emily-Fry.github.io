        <p> What is a responsive site? Why responsiveness is important?</p>
            <p> 
                Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
                It is an approach to design that enables the user to have the same experience regardless of the device or screen size they are viewing the content on.
            </p>
        <p> What is mobile first design and why it's important?</p>
            <p>
                The mobile-first approach is exactly as it sounds: designing for the smallest screen and working your way up. It is one of the best strategies to create either a responsive or adaptive design.
            </p>
        <p> What are frameworks, what are their pros and cons?</p>
            <p> 
                A CSS framework is a pre-prepared software framework that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid.
                Pros of using a framework include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Speeds up development</li>
                    <li>Enables cross border functionality</li>
                    <li>Gives clean, symetrical layouts</li>
                    <li>Enforces good web-design habits</li>
                </ul>
            <p>However, the cons include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restricted freedom</li>
                <li> Adds extra code</li>
                <li> Forces you to use the frameworks semantics</li>
            
            <p>I personally can see the benefits of using a framework once you understand the code inside them, but until you reach that point they can be very confusing.
                I think it will take a couple of practices to really get up to speed with them.

        <p>Aspects of my wireframes I found difficult to implement</p>
            <p> Almost all of them to be honest - I need more practice and time. I had particular difficulty with 
                my hero image, and getting any images to link into the CSS for some reason. I also struggled to use the frameworks
                to help me reach my desired outcome.
